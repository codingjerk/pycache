# Things I want to implement

## Map

□ `Map` to store cache independent if items are `Hashable`

□ Speedup `Map` with dictionary based on string representation

## Cache

□ `CachePolicy` interface to allow to use different cache policies

□ LRU/LFU/ARC cache policies

□ Item expiration

□ Cache statistics

□ `cache` decorator (with sane defaults)

## Etc

□ Add badges to README

□ Add usage and contribution sections to README

□ Write the docs

□ Write more benchmarks for typical usage as a cache
